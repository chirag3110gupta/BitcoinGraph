# CS225 Final Project Git Guidelines

- Each team member is required to work in their own branch based on the latest version of code from **master**. **Master** should always contained the latest working version of our codebase. Furthermore, **master** should **not** be edited or worked on directly to prevent breaking the codebase.

- Remember to only merge back into **master** if and only if your code/task is complete, bug-free, properly documented, and in compliance with the team style requirements.

- Make sure to check/update the [taskboard](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs225-fa20/chiragg4-anityak2-aditk3-alivabp2/projects/1) for our repository and stay up to date with your assigned [issues](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs225-fa20/chiragg4-anityak2-aditk3-alivabp2/issues).

- Commit messages must be clear and concise.

## Pull Requests: How To

When you complete a task in your branch and need to merge into **master**, you need to create a pull request. To do so, create one on the pull request page. When merging back into **master**, it is your **base**. If the branches are able to be merged complete the pull request and delete your old branch. Otherwise, resolve the conflicts safely and then merge! If you want to continue working on the same branch make sure that **master** and your branch are at the same level and continue working.
