# CS225 Final Project: Development

## Week 1:

- (***@team***) **November 13, 2020:** Today we all had our first group meeting during which we drafted and submitted our team contract and project proposal. Afterwards, Adit cleaned up the data while we discussed what characteristics and information to eliminate so he can do so. Adit and Aliva are both CS + Music majors so they did a lot of the eliminating of those characteristics, of course still running it by the other teammates and justifying the decisions. First and foremost, we all agreed in removing audiobooks and tracks which usually scored extremes on most relevant features, such as: white noise, nature sounds, etc… These items really made the dataset a lot more dense than it needed to be; they also don’t really fall under the scope of our project.

- (***@aditk3***) **November 13, 2020:** I used the Pandas Python library in a Jupyter Notebook environment to easily manipulate the data and get rid of unnecessary entries like audiobooks. I also tried figuring out different characteristics (columns) of the dataset that were not too important with my teammates over a Discord call and removed them, producing a cleaner dataset.

- (***@team***) **November 20, 2020:** Today we were unfortunately notified by our TA that our project idea does not fit in with the criteria of the actual project specs. We reconvened and chose a new data set, which we then cleaned up and prepared a new project proposal.

## Week 3:

- (***@team***) **November 23, 2020:** After receiving approval to proceed with our newly formed project idea we had another meeting today. We had a high level discussion in the design of our program and then began programming the skeleton as well as delegating tasks to establish a workflow. Chirag worked on the User class, while Adit worked on the Transactions class. Anit was responsible for the Graph class, in which Aliva was assigned the implementation of the BFS traversal. We also established our codestyle guidelines as well as workflow rules. Since Aliva is familiar with Git she explained the usage of branches to the rest of the team. We wrote a set of Git guidelines for the team, the main stipulation being that we all work in our own branches, leaving master as the latest functioning version of our codebase; merges into master are not permitted unless an individuals code is properly working. We also began using issues as well as a project board which can to assign tasks as well as keep record of our progress and document bugs and recommendations to one another. This can be seen in our repository.
- (***@alivabp2***) **November 24, 2020:** To implement a Breadth First (BFS) traversal of the graph, I needed to first understand the actual process and pseudocode which I did by drawing it out. Essentially, one must traverse the graph in a breadthward motion by using a queue to store visited vertices. As you traverse via adjacent vertices, you mark them as visited and insert them into the queue. If there is no additional adjacent vertex you pop the first vertex and repeat and continue the process until the graph has been traversed. For my implementation, I used a vector of booleans to keep track of visited vertices and a list of integers as my queue. I then tailored the implementation to fit the specific needs of our program; accessing the User ID of the target as the vertex.
