# CS225 Final Project Git Guidelines

Each team member is required to work in their own branch based on the latest version of code from master. Master should always contained the latest working version of our codebase. Furthermore, masters should not be edited or worked on directly to prevent breaking the codebase.

Remember to only merge back into master if and only if your code/task is complete, bug-free, properly documented, and in compliance with the team style requirements.

Make sure to check/update the task board for our repository and stay up to date with your assigned issues.

Commit messages must be clear and concise.
