# CS 225 Final Project
- This program organizes the Bitcoin OTC trust weighted signed network into graph structure. It uses the PageRank algorithm to find the most trusted/distrusted traders as well as Betweeness Centrality as a means of finding through which trader the most transactions pass through. There are a variety of real world applications for such a collection of algorithms, and in this case this program can be used in investigations and research in regards to Bitcoin transactions.

### How To Run: ###
- Clone/download the repository
- Run "**make**" in your terminal
- The command to run our program has several parameters:
  - **Command:** "**./final_proj**"
  - **Argument 2:** filepath to CSV data
  - **Argument 3:** a boolean signifying whether or not the CSV file has headings
  - **Argument 4:** the vertex wanted by the user (or "**all**")
  - **Argument 5:** program code
    - "**p**" is for PageRank
    - "**b**" is for Betweenness Centrality
    - "**f**" is to find path using BFS
  - **Argument 6:** one of the following
    - integer number of iterations for PageRank (defaults to 100); **optional**
    - integer target to find path; **optional**
- **Disclaimer:** In addition to the command, at least four parameters must be specified in order for the program to run!
- **Example CLI Command:** "**./final_proj assets/data.csv true all f 20 13**"
                           "**./final_proj assets/data.csv true all b**"
                           "**./final_proj assets/data.csv true all p 100**"
